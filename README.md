# Grocery-List
A program that includes multiple functions to edit a grocery list.

Description:
This allows a user to pick from 8 options: add an item to the grocery list, view the current grocery list, mark an item as bought, remove an item from the grocery list, remove all items from the grocery list, sort the list alphabetically, count the # of items on the grocery list, or exit the program. This code was written in a Python file and utilized lists and list methods. The most challenging part uin writing this code was creating the function to count the number of items on the grocery list. In the future, I hope to implement features that allow for two lists to be used at the same time.

How to Use:
Once the program is run, the user will be able to pick from the menu options. Pick an option from the menu and type its corresponding number. Enter any input that the function may ask for. After the option is carried out, the menu will continue to reappear until option 8: exit the program has been chosen.
